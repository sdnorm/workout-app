# Mobility & Flexibility Programming

## Routine Types

### Static Stretching
- Hold stretches for 30-60 seconds per position
- Best post-workout or on rest days
- Focus on muscles trained recently for recovery
- 2-3 sets per stretch, progressive depth
- Never stretch cold muscles to end range

### Dynamic Stretching
- Controlled movement through full range of motion
- Best pre-workout as warm-up
- 10-15 reps per movement, gradually increasing range
- Tempo: smooth and controlled, no bouncing
- Match movements to upcoming workout (e.g., leg swings before squats)

### Yoga-Based
- Combines static holds with dynamic flows
- Emphasizes breathing and body awareness
- Sun salutations for warm-up, held poses for flexibility
- Appropriate for any time — morning, pre/post workout, rest days
- Include both strength and flexibility poses

### Foam Rolling (Self-Myofascial Release)
- 30-60 seconds per muscle group
- Slow rolls, pause on tender spots for 20-30 seconds
- Best pre-workout (brief, 5-10 min) or post-workout/rest day (longer, 15-20 min)
- Moderate pressure — discomfort is fine, sharp pain is not
- Avoid rolling directly on joints or bones

## Focus Areas

### Full Body
- Hit all major muscle groups
- Good for general maintenance and rest days
- Balance between upper and lower body

### Hips
- Hip flexors (psoas, rectus femoris)
- Glutes (piriformis, gluteus medius)
- Adductors and abductors
- Hip internal and external rotation
- Critical for squat and deadlift mobility

### Shoulders
- Thoracic extension
- Shoulder flexion and external rotation
- Pec minor and lat flexibility
- Rotator cuff mobility
- Important for pressing and overhead movements

### Spine
- Thoracic rotation and extension
- Lumbar decompression
- Cat-cow and segmental movements
- Avoid aggressive end-range lumbar flexion under load

### Lower Body
- Hamstrings, quads, calves
- Ankle dorsiflexion
- Hip flexors
- IT band and TFL

### Upper Body
- Chest and shoulders
- Lats and upper back
- Forearms and wrists
- Neck and traps

### Ankles
- Dorsiflexion mobility (critical for squats)
- Calf stretches (gastroc and soleus)
- Ankle circles and CARs
- Banded joint mobilizations

### Wrists
- Wrist flexion and extension
- Wrist circles and CARs
- Prayer stretch variations
- Important for front rack, push-ups, handstands

## Duration Guidelines
- **10 min**: Quick targeted routine, 4-6 exercises, one focus area
- **15 min**: Moderate routine, 6-8 exercises, one or two focus areas
- **20 min**: Thorough routine, 8-10 exercises, two or three focus areas
- **30 min**: Comprehensive routine, 10-14 exercises, full body or deep focus

## Programming Considerations
- Post-workout: focus on muscles just trained, static stretching preferred
- Pre-workout: dynamic stretching for the muscles about to be trained
- Rest days: longer routines, any type, good for recovery
- Complement recent training — if legs were trained, hip and ankle mobility
- If shoulders were trained, shoulder and thoracic mobility
- Consistency matters more than duration
