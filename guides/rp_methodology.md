# RP Hypertrophy Methodology — System Context

This document provides the AI with context about Renaissance Periodization (RP) training principles for generating intelligent workout programs.

## Core Principles

### Volume Landmarks (Sets Per Muscle Group Per Week)
- **MV (Maintenance Volume)**: Minimum sets to maintain current muscle size. Typically 4-6 sets/week.
- **MEV (Minimum Effective Volume)**: Minimum sets to make gains. Typically 6-10 sets/week.
- **MAV (Maximum Adaptive Volume)**: The sweet spot where most growth occurs. Typically 12-20 sets/week.
- **MRV (Maximum Recoverable Volume)**: The most you can do and still recover. Going over = overtraining. Typically 18-25 sets/week.

### Mesocycle Structure
A mesocycle is a training block typically lasting 4-6 weeks:
- **Week 1**: Start at or near MEV. Get used to exercises, practice form.
- **Week 2**: Add 1-2 sets per muscle group from week 1.
- **Week 3**: Add 1-2 more sets. Volume approaching MAV.
- **Week 4**: Peak volume near MAV/MRV. Highest training stimulus.
- **Deload Week**: Cut volume to MV, reduce weight by 50%. Full recovery.

### RIR (Reps in Reserve) Progression
RIR indicates how many reps you could have done before failure:
- **Week 1**: 3-4 RIR (conservative, learning weights)
- **Week 2**: 2-3 RIR (moderate effort)
- **Week 3**: 1-2 RIR (hard training)
- **Week 4**: 0-1 RIR (near failure, maximum stimulus)
- **Deload**: 4-5 RIR (very easy)

### Progressive Overload
Each workout should aim to beat the previous one for the same muscle group:
1. **Add reps** within the target range (e.g., went from 8 to 10 reps)
2. **Add weight** when hitting the top of rep range (e.g., hit 12 reps → increase weight, drop to 8 reps)
3. **Add sets** as mesocycle progresses (volume progression)

### Exercise Selection Principles
- **Compound movements first**: Start with big compound lifts (squats, bench, rows), then isolation.
- **Exercise variation**: Rotate exercises between mesocycles, but keep them consistent within a mesocycle.
- **Muscle group coverage**: Ensure all muscle groups get sufficient volume across the training week.
- **Equipment matching**: Select exercises based on available equipment (home vs gym).
- **Individual response**: If a muscle group is lagging, prioritize it with more volume and exercise variety.

### Split Types
- **Push/Pull/Legs (PPL)**: 3-day rotation. Push = chest/shoulders/triceps. Pull = back/biceps/rear delts. Legs = quads/hamstrings/glutes/calves.
- **Upper/Lower**: 2-day rotation. Upper = chest/back/shoulders/arms. Lower = quads/hamstrings/glutes/calves.
- **Full Body**: Every muscle group each session. Good for 2-3 days/week.

### Deload Indicators
Time to deload when:
- Performance declining across multiple sessions
- Joint pain or unusual soreness
- End of planned mesocycle (typically week 4-6)
- Sleep quality declining
- Motivation dropping significantly

### Rep Ranges by Goal
- **Strength focus**: 3-6 reps, heavier weight
- **Hypertrophy (primary)**: 8-12 reps, moderate weight
- **Metabolite/pump**: 12-20 reps, lighter weight
- Most hypertrophy work should be in the 8-15 rep range

## Volume Recommendations by Muscle Group

| Muscle Group | MEV (sets/wk) | MAV (sets/wk) | MRV (sets/wk) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chest | 8 | 12-20 | 22 |
| Back | 8 | 12-20 | 22 |
| Quads | 6 | 12-18 | 20 |
| Hamstrings | 4 | 8-14 | 16 |
| Glutes | 0 | 4-12 | 16 |
| Side Delts | 6 | 16-22 | 26 |
| Rear Delts | 0 | 8-16 | 22 |
| Front Delts | 0 | 4-8 | 12 |
| Biceps | 4 | 10-16 | 20 |
| Triceps | 4 | 8-14 | 18 |
| Calves | 6 | 10-16 | 20 |
| Abs | 0 | 8-16 | 20 |
| Traps | 0 | 8-14 | 20 |
| Forearms | 0 | 4-10 | 16 |

## Workout Generation Rules

When generating a workout:
1. Check which muscle groups are scheduled for today's session based on the split.
2. Look at volume targets for this week of the mesocycle.
3. Select exercises appropriate for the location (home/gym).
4. Order exercises: compounds first, then isolations.
5. Assign sets based on weekly volume target divided across sessions for that muscle group.
6. Assign rep ranges (primarily 8-12, with some variation).
7. Set RIR target based on the current week of the mesocycle.
8. Reference last workout data to suggest appropriate weights (same or slightly higher).
9. Provide brief coaching cues for form on key exercises.
